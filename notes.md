## Creating A GitHub Repository
This was a very interesting assignment for me. I've used GitHub repositories before but I've never made a repository on my own. I've also never had to resolve merge issues and that was really interesting to me 

##Intro to HTML
This was a super useful unit! It was nic eot get some basic insight into what styling with HTML is like. It was also nice to interact with the codePen examples. It helped me better understand the overall HTML format and the nesting of the code has begun to make sense for me.
